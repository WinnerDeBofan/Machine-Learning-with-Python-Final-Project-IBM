# Machine-Learning-with-Python-Final-Project-IBM
This final project Machine Learning with Python IBM 
This project will use a rainfall dataset from Australian Government's Bureau of Meteorology

You are expected to use the following algorithms to build your models:
1.  Linear Regression
2.  KNN
3.  Decision Trees
4.  Logistic Regression
5.  SVM

The results are reported as the accuracy of each classifier, using the following metrics, when these are applicable:
1. Accuracy Score
2. Jaccard Index
3. F1-Score
4. LogLoss
5. Mean Absolute Error
6. Mean Squared Error
7. R2-Score

1.     Splitting the dataset into training and testing data for regression

2.     Building and training a model using Linear Regression and calculating evaluation metrics

3.     Creating a final regression report/table of evaluation metrics

4.     Building and training a model using KNN and calculating evaluation metrics

5.     Building and training a model using Decision Trees and calculating evaluation metrics

6.     Building and training a model using Logistic Regression and calculating evaluation metrics

7.     Building and training a model using SVM and calculating evaluation metrics

8.     Creating a final classification report/table of evaluation metrics
